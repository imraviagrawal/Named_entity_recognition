# Named_entity_recognition
Implemented several different models for named entity recognition (NER). NER is a
subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined
categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary
values, percentages, etc. In the assignment, for a given a word in a context, we want to predict whether it
represents one of four categories:

Person (PER): e.g. \Martha Stewart", \Obama", \Tim Wagner", etc. Pronouns like \he" or \she" are
not considered named entities.

Organization (ORG): e.g. \American Airlines", \Goldman Sachs", \Department of Defense".


Location (LOC): e.g. \Germany", \Panama Strait", \Brussels", but not unnamed locations like \the
bar" or \the farm".

Miscellaneous (MISC): e.g. \Japanese", \USD", \1,000", \Englishmen".
